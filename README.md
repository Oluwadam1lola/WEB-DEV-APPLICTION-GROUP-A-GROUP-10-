**Contribution:** I developed the database structure(database.sql) part that powers the entire enrollment system. This SQL file defines all necessary tables including: students, courses, and enrollments and also includes demo data for testing and demonstration purposes.
The SQL database serves as the *core memory* of the project, storing all student information, course details, and enrollment records. It allows data to persist and be retrieved dynamically by the PHP scripts. I also configured the congig.php file, which establishes a connection between the PHP application and the MySQL database. This connection ensures that the application can communicate with the database â€” retrieving, inserting, and managing data in real time. Together, these components form the foundation that binds the front-end forms and the back-end logic, enabling a fully functional enrollment workflow.
